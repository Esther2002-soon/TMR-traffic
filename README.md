# Traffic-Aware Multi-Degradation Restoration
Nighttime rainy conditions introduce multiple      degradations in traffic surveillance imagery, including low illumination, rain streaks, raindrop occlusion, and motion blur. While recent advances in single-image deraining [1], low-light enhancement [2], and deblurring [3] have shown promising results, existing works predominantly address only one type of degradation, which limits their applicability to real-world intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a Traffic-Aware Multi-Degradation Restoration (TMR) framework that jointly restores nighttime rainy traffic images. Specifically, we design a dual-path Retinex-inspired network that separately models illumination and high-frequency components, augmented with a learnable spectral mask in    the frequency domain for effective suppression of rain streaks and noise. To ensure robust structural recovery, we incorporate perceptual and SSIM-based loss functions, in addition to conventional reconstruction metrics. For training, we construct a synthetic paired dataset by combining NightCity (nighttime traffic imagery) [4] with extracted rain layers from Rain100L [1], and augment them with blur kernels and noise injection to approximate real-world degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TMR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art deraining and low-light enhancement methods in both PSNR and SSIM, while also providing better feature consistency for downstream tasks such as vehicle and pedestrian detection. Finally, we envision that our lightweight design makes the framework highly suitable for edge deployment on vehicular dashcams, enabling clear visual perception regardless of adverse weather and lighting conditions.
